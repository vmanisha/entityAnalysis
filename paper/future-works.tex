We presented our preliminary results in using entity linking in order
to find hidden connections between popular and rare queries. 
In this work we observed that: i) spots and entities 
in the head and in the tail of the AOL query log follow similar trends but ii) 
the most frequent entities are different iii) the more spots a query contains 
(i.e., the longer it is) the highest is the probability that head entities and
tail entities co-occur. For future work, we would like to improve the quality 
of entity linking, implementing state of the art methods for entity linking on queries and
exploiting other informations in the logs (sessions, clicks\dots). Finally, it would 
be interesting studying the relationships among the entities mined in the querylog
(e.g., they occur in the same query, or in the same session, the share the same click \dots) and
compare them with the relations that we have in the knowledge base.
