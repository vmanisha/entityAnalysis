We presented our preliminary results on using entity linking in order
to find hidden connections between popular and rare queries. 
In this work we observed that: i) spots and entities 
in the head and in the tail of the AOL query log follow similar trends but ii) 
the most frequent entities are different iii) the more spots a query contains 
(i.e., the longer it is) the higher is the probability that head entities and
tail entities co-occur. For future work, we would like to improve the quality 
of entity linking, implementing state of the art methods on queries and
exploiting other informations in the logs (sessions, clicks etc). Finally, it
would be interesting to study the relationships among the entities identified in
the query log (e.g., they occur in the same query, in same session or share same
clicks) and compare them with the relations that we have in the knowledge base.
