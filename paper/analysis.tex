Let us first define \shead{} and \stail{}, the sets containing the spots detected in the 
\head{} and \tail{}. In this preliminary work we decided also to map each spot 
to the entity with the \emph{highest commonness}, i.e., the highest probability $p(e|s)$
to be associated with the spot $s$ considered. Let us denote with \ehead{} and \etail{}
the sets containing the most probable entities for the spots. It is worth to note
that this mapping could collapse different spots on the same entity (e.g., \emph{united states} and 
\emph{usa} will both refer the United States country). 

We identified $11,152$ ($|$\shead{}$|$)  distinct spots and $8,949$ ($|$\ehead{}$|$) distinct 
entities in the head. In the tail, we found $550,953$ ($|$\stail{}$|$) distinct spots and 
$379,342$ ($|$\etail{}$|$) distinct entities. It  is also interesting to note that 
$|$  \shead{} $\cap$ \stail{} $| = 11,027 |$  $|$ \ehead{} $\cap$ \etail{} $| = 8,888$, that 
means that almost all the spots and entities in the head appear in the tail. 
We then analyze spots and entities frequency distributions in head and tail, 
depicted in Figure~\ref{img:distributions}: it is interesting note that while queries 
in head and tail follow totally different distributions, when we look at their 
spots/entities the distributions are similar \diego{add more comments on the graph}

% diego put this in the intro if there's space
% Tail queries have been often mapped to the head \cite{} by using bag-of-word representations.
% Lately they have also been linked with the head queries through entities. However, in this work
% we attempt to study the extent to which the entities in the tail queries can be linked to entities
% in the head queries. It is important to know how much will entity linking at tail benefit query mining.
% We shall, from now on refer to entities in head queries as `head entity'
% and entities occuring in the tail as `tail entity'.


% We begin by analyzing the volume of entities found in the tail. Of X unique tail queries,
% 63.2\% contain atleast one entity.
%Of queries containing more than one entity, 86.2\% queries contain atleast one head entity. 
%Once, the queries in the tail are tagged with entities, 
Next we look at what fraction of queries containing either only head entities, \emph{tail entities}, i.e., entities 
that appear \emph{only} in the tail ($\in$ \etail{} $\setminus$ \ehead{})
or both head and tail entities. Figure \ref{img:headTailEntPercent} shows the percentage of 
queries with only head or tail entities or both. One can clearly see that a large percentage of tail 
queries contain both head and tail entities. Moreover, this percentage gradually rises with the 
number of entities in the query. This could mean that in longer queries people is looking 
for connections among popular entities and rare entities.

\end{figure}
 
% Provided that such a large percentage of tail queries contain both head and tail entities, it
% will be useful to see the ratio of head entities to tail entities in these queries. Especially,
% for queries with more than 2 entities, it would be interesting to see whether head queries occur more
% than tail queries or vice versa. Table \ref{table:entDist} shows the number of entities in the query,
% number of such queries and the average head to tail entity ratio of these queries.
% Although, there are queries with more than 6 entities, they are too few to draw any significant
% conclusions. PLEASE ADD > 6 RESULTS AS WELL.

% Head to Tail entity ratio is calculated by dividing number of head entities with number of
% tail entities in the query, i.e. $E_{head}/E_{tail}$. It is interesting to note that queries with
% more entities have almost equal number of head and tail entities. Few query examples are provided in
% Table \ref{table:queriesWithEnt}. The entities are in bold. What is interesting is the nature of tail
% entities that co-occur with the head.

%Head entity popularity
% Given that there would several head entities, not all of them will be equally popular.
% Here, popularity of the entity refers to the scope of that entity, how many entities does
% it co-occur with, or how common is that entity.
% Figure \ref{img:headEntDist} shows the frequency distribution of head entities in the
% head queries. That is, how frequently does a head entity occur in popular queries.
% To aggregate statistics for the tail, we divide head entities into 7 buckets, each bucket
% spanning 20\% of entities. This results in X popular entities being in 0-20\% range, Y
% entities in 20-40\% range, so on and so forth.
