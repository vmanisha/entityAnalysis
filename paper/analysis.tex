\subsection{Entity Stats}
Entities in Head ($E_{head}$): 8949
Entities in Tail ($E_{tail}$): 379342
Total Count of entities in Head : 6562784
Total Count of entities in Tail : 9764565

Tail queries have been often mapped to the head \cite{} by using bag-of-word representations.
Lately they have also been linked with the head queries through entities. However, in this work
we attempt to study the extent to which the entities in the tail queries can be linked to entities 
in the head queries. It is important to know how much will entity linking at tail benefit query mining. 
We shall, from now on refer to entities in head queries as `head entity' 
and entities occuring in the tail as `tail entity'. 


We begin by analyzing the volume of entities found in the tail. Of X unique tail queries,
63.2\% contain atleast one entity. 
%Of queries containing more than one entity, 86.2\% queries contain atleast one head entity. 
%Once, the queries in the tail are tagged with entities, 
Next we look at what fraction of queries containing either only head entities, only tail entities 
or both head and tail entities. Figure \ref{img:headTailEntPercent} shows the percentage of 
queries with only head or tail entities or both. One can clearly see that a large percentage of tail 
queries contain both head and tail entities. Moreover, this percentage gradually rises with the 
number of entities in the query. HOW DOES IT HELP?

Provided that such a large percentage of tail queries contain both head and tail entities, it 
will be usefull to see the ratio of head entities to tail entities in these queries. Especially, 
for queries with more than 2 entities, it would be interesting to see whether head queries occur more
than tail queries or vice versa. Table \ref{table:entDist} shows the number of entities in the query, 
number of such queries and the average head to tail entity ratio of these queries.
Although, there are queries with more than 6 entities, they are too few to draw any significant 
conclusions. PLEASE ADD > 6 RESULTS AS WELL.

Head to Tail entity ratio is calculated by dividing number of head entities with number of 
tail entities in the query, i.e. $E_{head}/E_{tail}$. It is interesting to note that queries with
more entities have almost equal number of head and tail entities. Few query examples are provided in
Table \ref{table:queriesWithEnt}. The entities are in bold. What is interesting is the nature of tail
entities that co-occur with the head.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\#Entities & \#Queries & Head Tail Ratio \\ \hline

%The table clearly shows that for every tail entity there is a head entity in the query.

%Head entity popularity
Given that there would several head entities, not all of them will be equally popular. 
Here, popularity of the entity refers to the scope of that entity, how many entities does 
it co-occur with, or how common is that entity. 
Figure \ref{img:headEntDist} shows the frequency distribution of head entities in the 
head queries. That is, how frequently does a head entity occur in popular queries. 
To aggregate statistics for the tail, we divide head entities into 7 buckets, each bucket
spanning 20\% of entities. This results in X popular entities being in 0-20\% range, Y 
entities in 20-40\% range, so on and so forth.
